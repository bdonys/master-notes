# MASTER-NOTES

## Your Task

Your assignment is to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.


## DESCRIPTION

This project is to create a functional back end for an existing front end code. When a user opens this note taking application, the user will be able to click on the link to the notes page.
The user will be presented with a page of existing notes on the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column.
The user will have the option to click on a Save button, in which will appear on the left hand column. The user will also have an option to delete existing notes.
